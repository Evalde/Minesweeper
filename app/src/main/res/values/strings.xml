    <string name="rules">Minesweeper is a game about clearing a minefield by identifying mines with flags.
    To begin the game, click on a square. Your first click will never be on a mine. The map will be revealed
    along with numbers on the grid. The number in a revealed square indicates the number of adjacent mines.
    To place a flag, long click on an unrevealed square. Reveal every square not occupied by bombs to win the game.</string>
